    <h1>Client</h1>
    <p>When deciding on a webpage for myself, I wanting something practical. Something I can actually use in real life
        to demstrate my skills and accomplishments. I debated exactly what I wanted the site to be, but eventually
        decided on a page to show off my theatre accomplishments. I used AI to help with some ideas for the page, and
        landed on a home page where I could introduce myself and my acting philosophy, a gallery page to show photos of
        productions I've been in, and a script archive where I can include my favorite scripts and monolougues. This
        gives me one place to turn for audition material, as well as a sort of resume to show potential directors. The
        lead and junior developers did a really good job putting the site together. There were no issues with
        communication. I could nitpick it (images load slowly, and a couple images are off center), but overall they
        exceeded my expectations. If I were to actually hire a team for a site I would try to be more involved. Checking
        up on progress and nitpicking the final product.</p>

    <h2>Lead Developer</h2>
    <p>I was tasked with designing a ticket sales page for Justin Rodriguez called BandLive. I used teams to communicate
        with both my juniors and the client and that is where we shared progress and the link to the page. Things went
        fairly smoothly. His wireframe took a second to figure out, but I was able to design the page without any issues
        after that. There was a little bit of a miscommunication with the Client about getting access to the images he
        wanted on the page, but it was quickly figured out. The CSS was definately harder than the HTML, but it did come
        together eventually. My junior developers were pretty on top of their work as well. There was some
        miscommunication about how I was getting their code and about designing the CSS for the sub pages. The developer
        for the Pop page designed his own CSS from the ground up rather than using mine as a base, and the designer for
        the Rock page just used my CSS without making any adjustments. I ended up having to edit the CSS for the Pop
        page, putting it into my CSS and removing anything that didn't work with mine to make it uniform. The Rock page
        ended up looking OK so I just left it. Using Github was confusing for me at first, but once I got help in class
        things went smoothly.</p>

    <h3>Junior Developer</h3>
    <p>For Anderson's Soulsync website, we used Teams to communicate and I was in charge of the second child page, the
        Mood Playlists page. Our lead, Lettie, did a great job of encouraging us and assigning tasks despite the client
        having poor communication and the site plan being very confusing. I was very confused which wireframe I was
        supposed to use, and the Lead was as well. Once we eventually got that figured out, things went relatively
        smoothly on my end. I did my best with what was given to me. It ended up being the most simple to just send my
        code directly to the lead and have her add it to the repository. </p>

    <h3>Junior Developer</h3>
    <p>For Atkins' drone website, I was in charge of the contact page. We used Teams to communicate. The Lead, Tyler,
        was initially quick on communication and making assignments. The lead ended up having some issues with the
        repository so we had to be reinvited, and to my understanding he had some personal stuff come up that limited
        our communication. I got the html done without much issue and sent to code to my lead. As of the time of writing
        this, I have not recieved any CSS from the lead and thus have been unable to to complete the page.</p>

    <h4>General Reflections</h4>
    <p>Overall, I enjoyed this assignment. It was kind of fun figuring out how to build a real website on my own. The
        most difficult part was largly communication. Understanding what the client wanted and how to impliment it could
        be tricky and sometime I had to wait for responses from my lead developers before I could continue my work. If I
        were to do such a project again, I would love to sit down with the whole team in person at the beginning of the
        project and go over it together so expectations were set. I definately feel like I have learned in this class.
        Taking on such a project again without in-class help feel rather intimidating. I'm not 100% confident I could do
        it on my own, but I would be willing to try. </p>
